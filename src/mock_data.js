        title: 'HELP!! - FPS drop in ALL games; 60fps to 10 fps',
        message: `Hello everyone :D


        First off, my system specs are;
        Alienware M14X Laptop. (Approx. 1 year old)
        GPU: GeForce GT 650M
        Intel i7 3740QM at 2.70GHz
        12 gigs of RAM
        Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit
        Current NVIDIA driver version: 335.23
        
        I am having really bad problems. EVERY SINGLE game I have is unplayable. Let me explain.
        
        For example, on Thief, I run the game and it starts at a brilliant straight 60, 70 or 80 fps. In the loading screen, it drops to about 30. Then, when in game again, it sits at about 50-60 fps. The longer I play, the more it drops. After about 3-5 minutes, I'm sitting at 20-30 fps. This isn't an instant drop. It drops slowly, and I'm losing about 3 frames every second. Then after a few more minutes, it drops again to 7-15 fps. This SUCKS!!!
        
        I've found that disabling background processes in the task manager shoots the fps back up to 40-60, but after about 30 seconds it drops back down to 7-15. I have to shut down a background process every 3 minutes if I want to play the game without ridiculous lag. Eventually, after I have disabled EVERY SINGLE background process, even Windows Explorer, Thief plays at 60 for about two minutes before dropping down to 7-15 over the space of 20 seconds.
        
        My Thief settings are set at the GeForce experience recommendations, which are:
        
        Contract Hardening Shadows: Off
        Depth of Field Quality: Normal (which is the lowest setting)
        Display Mode: Full-screen
        FXAA: On
        Parallax Occlusion Mapping: Off
        Resolution: 1280 X 800
        Screenspace Reflection: Off
        Shadow Quality: Low
        SSAA: Off
        Tessellation: Off
        Texture Filtering Quality: 16X Anisotropic
        Texture Filtering Quality: High
        
        
        A similar thing happens in Need for Speed: Rivals. I start off at a strong 30 (the game is limited to 30 fps) and after about one minute of driving, I drop down to 7 fps. This isn't an instant drop, either. It falls over the course of about 30 seconds.
        
        My NFS: Rivals settings:
        Ambient Occlusion: Off
        Display Mode: Full-Screen
        Effects Quality: Low
        Headlight Shadows: Off
        Lighting Quality: Low
        Motion Blur: Off
        Reflection Quality: Low (I can't turn it off)
        Resolution: 1400 X 900
        
        The game runs at 30 fps in the loading screen, and when I start driving.
        Over the course of the next 4 minutes, it drops from 30, to 20, stays on 20 for a while, goes to 10, and finally doesn't go below 5 (thank GOD).
        
        This happens with ALL my games. Hitman Absolution, Civ 5, Metro Last Light, Borderlands 2, Saint's Row the Third, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Tomb Raider (2013).
        
        It also might be worth mentioning that:
        These games run off a 500gb Seagate external hard drive. (Not SSD)
        
        My Alienware is propped up against a book. There's plenty of airflow underneath the computer. (I used to have the back of the computer resting on top of the very same external hard drive mentioned above. Maybe this damaged it? I don't know.
        
        I always have FRAPS running. That's how I know my fps. I WAS NOT recording during these tests.
        
        Please help me with this, guys. I've had this problem for about 4 months, and I can't play any games. :'(
        
        Thanks in advance,
        D`,
