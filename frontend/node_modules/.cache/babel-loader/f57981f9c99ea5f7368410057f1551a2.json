(Approx. 1 year old)\n        GPU: GeForce GT 650M\n        Intel i7 3740QM at 2.70GHz\n        12 gigs of RAM\n        Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit\n        Current NVIDIA driver version: 335.23\n        \n        I am having really bad problems. EVERY SINGLE game I have is unplayable. Let me explain.\n        \n        For example, on Thief, I run the game and it starts at a brilliant straight 60, 70 or 80 fps. In the loading screen, it drops to about 30. Then, when in game again, it sits at about 50-60 fps. The longer I play, the more it drops. After about 3-5 minutes, I'm sitting at 20-30 fps. This isn't an instant drop. It drops slowly, and I'm losing about 3 frames every second. Then after a few more minutes, it drops again to 7-15 fps. This SUCKS!!!\n        \n        I've found that disabling background processes in the task manager shoots the fps back up to 40-60, but after about 30 seconds it drops back down to 7-15. I have to shut down a background process every 3 minutes if I want to play the game without ridiculous lag. Eventually, after I have disabled EVERY SINGLE background process, even Windows Explorer, Thief plays at 60 for about two minutes before dropping down to 7-15 over the space of 20 seconds.\n        \n        My Thief settings are set at the GeForce experience recommendations, which are:\n        \n        Contract Hardening Shadows: Off\n        Depth of Field Quality: Normal (which is the lowest setting)\n        Display Mode: Full-screen\n        FXAA: On\n        Parallax Occlusion Mapping: Off\n        Resolution: 1280 X 800\n        Screenspace Reflection: Off\n        Shadow Quality: Low\n        SSAA: Off\n        Tessellation: Off\n        Texture Filtering Quality: 16X Anisotropic\n        Texture Filtering Quality: High\n        \n        \n        A similar thing happens in Need for Speed: Rivals. I start off at a strong 30 (the game is limited to 30 fps) and after about one minute of driving, I drop down to 7 fps. This isn't an instant drop, either. It falls over the course of about 30 seconds.\n        \n        My NFS: Rivals settings:\n        Ambient Occlusion: Off\n        Display Mode: Full-Screen\n        Effects Quality: Low\n        Headlight Shadows: Off\n        Lighting Quality: Low\n        Motion Blur: Off\n        Reflection Quality: Low (I can't turn it off)\n        Resolution: 1400 X 900\n        \n        The game runs at 30 fps in the loading screen, and when I start driving.\n        Over the course of the next 4 minutes, it drops from 30, to 20, stays on 20 for a while, goes to 10, and finally doesn't go below 5 (thank GOD).\n        \n        This happens with ALL my games. Hitman Absolution, Civ 5, Metro Last Light, Borderlands 2, Saint's Row the Third, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Tomb Raider (2013).\n        \n        It also might be worth mentioning that:\n        These games run off a 500gb Seagate external hard drive. (Not SSD)\n        \n        My Alienware is propped up against a book. There's plenty of airflow underneath the computer. (I used to have the back of the computer resting on top of the very same external hard drive mentioned above. Maybe this damaged it? I don't know.\n        \n        I always have FRAPS running. That's how I know my fps. I WAS NOT recording during these tests.\n        \n        Please help me with this, guys.
