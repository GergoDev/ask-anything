      "title": "HELP!! - FPS drop in ALL games; 60fps to 10 fps",
      "message": "Hello everyone :D\nFirst off, my system specs are;\nAlienware M14X Laptop. (Approx. 1 year old)\nGPU: GeForce GT 650M\nIntel i7 3740QM at 2.70GHz\n12 gigs of RAM\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64 bit\nCurrent NVIDIA driver version: 335.23\nI am having really bad problems. EVERY SINGLE game I have is unplayable. Let me explain.\nFor example, on Thief, I run the game and it starts at a brilliant straight 60, 70 or 80 fps. In the loading screen, it drops to about 30. Then, when in game again, it sits at about 50-60 fps. The longer I play, the more it drops. After about 3-5 minutes, I'm sitting at 20-30 fps. This isn't an instant drop. It drops slowly, and I'm losing about 3 frames every second. Then after a few more minutes, it drops again to 7-15 fps. This SUCKS!!!\nI've found that disabling background processes in the task manager shoots the fps back up to 40-60, but after about 30 seconds it drops back down to 7-15. I have to shut down a background process every 3 minutes if I want to play the game without ridiculous lag. Eventually, after I have disabled EVERY SINGLE background process, even Windows Explorer, Thief plays at 60 for about two minutes before dropping down to 7-15 over the space of 20 seconds.\nMy Thief settings are set at the GeForce experience recommendations, which are:\nContract Hardening Shadows: Off\nDepth of Field Quality: Normal (which is the lowest setting)\nDisplay Mode: Full-screen\nFXAA: On\nParallax Occlusion Mapping: Off\nResolution: 1280 X 800\nScreenspace Reflection: Off\nShadow Quality: Low\nSSAA: Off\nTessellation: Off\nTexture Filtering Quality: 16X Anisotropic\nTexture Filtering Quality: High\n\nA similar thing happens in Need for Speed: Rivals. I start off at a strong 30 (the game is limited to 30 fps) and after about one minute of driving, I drop down to 7 fps. This isn't an instant drop, either. It falls over the course of about 30 seconds.\nMy NFS: Rivals settings:\nAmbient Occlusion: Off\nDisplay Mode: Full-Screen\nEffects Quality: Low\nHeadlight Shadows: Off\nLighting Quality: Low\nMotion Blur: Off\nReflection Quality: Low (I can't turn it off)\nResolution: 1400 X 900\n",
